## Intepretation

We know the model starts learning simple shapes in earlier layers, and increasily complicated and refined features in deeper layers. 

Here we are trying to get further into those features, and check **what exactly are the features the model use to distinguish objects**, and get some intuition of how to **augment the training set**, so that the model can learn more, and return robust predictions.
